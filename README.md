Classified and georeferenced static images into interactive land-use maps to analyze temporal changes

Most land use maps in cities in developing countries are stored as static images in PDFs. As part of research for Energy Policy Institute at Chicago (EPIC), I converted static images from 1972 to 2015 of a major city into interactive & classified land use maps using computer vision (OpenCV) and georeferencing (QGIS). 

While I cannot share the interactive maps themselves, the code outlines how to go about a similar process for any other city.
